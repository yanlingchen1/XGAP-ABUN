Program trafo: transform data to SPEX 2.0 format
This is version 1.04, of trafo

 Are your data in OGIP format            : type=1
 Old (Version 1.10 and below) SPEX format: type=2
 New (Version 2.00 and above) SPEX format: type=3

 Enter the type: 1
 Enter the number of spectra you want to transform: 1
 Enter the maximum number of response groups per energy per spectrum: 1

 How should the matrix be partioned? 
 Option 1: keep as provided (1 component, no re-arrangements)
 Option 2: rearrange into contiguous groups
 Option 3: split into N roughly equal-sized components
 Enter your preferred option (1,2,3): 1
 Do you want to calculate the response derivatives (if not available)? (y/n) [no]:n

 Default value of FCHAN is 1
 Checking data quality and grouping ...
 Ogip files have quality flags. Quality 0 means okay
 Your spectrum file has          0 bins with bad quality
 Your background file has        0 bins with bad quality
 Your combined file has          0 bins with bad quality
 Shall we use these quality flags to ignore bad channels? (y/n) [no]:y
 Determining background subtracted spectra ...
